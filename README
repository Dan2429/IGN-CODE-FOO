IGN Application 


1)    To figure out how many pennies would fit in the Golden Gate Bridge, assuming the bridge is empty, I first had to find the area of the bridge. The area of the bridge was 75,050.79sqm the area of a penny is 3.14sqcm. I divided the areas and answer was
571,282,920.2 so the total amount of pennies that would fit on the Golden Gate Bridge is 571,282,920.

2)   The 16:9 image ratio would use a 1024x576 which is all I could figure I have never had any training on image resolutions.

3)   The knight has to make a minimum of 29 moves to cover the entire chess board.

4)   Since a young age I have been interested in technology and learning how it works. An internship at IGN would help me learn about the latest technology for programmers and how to use them. Along with all tools and resources needed to advance as a programmer I would be surrounded by others that share my passion for technology and video games.
     IGN would greatly benefit from having me in its team for my value as team member, ability to learn quickly and passion for anything that has to do with technology and video games. Ultimately what I am looking for in IGN is to be employed and actually enjoy my job, being around others who also share my passion for technology. I know this internship is what I need to advance and learn all of the new technologies I just need the opportunity.
